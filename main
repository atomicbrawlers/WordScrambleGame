/* What I want to do:
input 5 words as strings
make all strings capitalized
scramble words randomly
output all scrambled words; numbered 1-5
ask which word the user wants to guess (1-5)
redisplay scrambled word that is being guessed, take input for guess
if correct, say so and redisplay all the words //correct words are no longer scrambled, bold?
if incorrect, say so and redisplay all the words //correct words are no longer scrambled, bold?
if all are correct, display all the words, display "You win!"
*/

/* How to do what I want to do:
use loop to put each letter of each word into 5 arrays
use loop to randomly generate numbers to shuffle letters in the array
if possible, put back into a single string, if not, display each letter

when (numCorrect == 5), say "You win!" and end program
